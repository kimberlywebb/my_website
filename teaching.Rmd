## Teaching Philosophy
As an instructor of statistics, my goal is to prepare students to apply their quantitative skills to their interests, passions, and problems. It is important that I prepare students to approach problems holistically and in context. I plan to achieve this goal through... 

- Hands-on experiences with real-world data   
- Exposure to a variety of statistical applications   

I believe that bringing multiple perspectives to the classroom and allowing students to have personal choice in projects and datasets facilitates an inclusive and relevant learning environment.
